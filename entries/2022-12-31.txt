Lonely Nights

The nights are the hardest. When the silence creeps in and all I can hear is the sound of my own heartbeat. When the darkness surrounds me, and all I can see is your face, floating in my mind like a ghost.

I miss you, my love. I miss you so much it hurts. I miss your touch, your voice, your laughter. I miss the way you used to make me feel, like I was the only person in the world that mattered.

But now you're gone, and I'm left with this loneliness that consumes me. I try to keep busy, I try to fill the void, but nothing seems to work.

I just want you back, my love. I just want to hold you in my arms again, and never let you go.
