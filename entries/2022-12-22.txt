Memories

I close my eyes and all I can see is you. Your face, your eyes, your hair, your smile. Every memory we made together is etched into my mind, and I can't seem to shake them loose.

I remember the first time we met, the first time we kissed, the first time you told me you loved me. I remember every moment we spent together, and it brings me both joy and pain.

Joy because of how happy we were, and pain because of how much I miss you. I never thought I could miss someone this much, but here I am, missing you more and more with each passing day.

I hope you're doing well, my love. I hope you're happy, and I hope you think of me too.
