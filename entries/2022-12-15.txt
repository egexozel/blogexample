Missing You

I miss you more with each passing day. Your smile, your laugh, the way you used to hold my hand. I still feel the warmth of your touch even though you're gone.

Every morning, I wake up to the emptiness that you've left behind. Every night, I lay in bed and imagine you next to me, like you used to be.

I can't help but think of all the good times we had together, and how I took them for granted. I never appreciated how lucky I was to have you by my side.

But now you're gone, and I'm left with this void in my heart that nothing can fill. I miss you, my love.sss fffff
